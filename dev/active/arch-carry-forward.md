# Architect Carry-Forward — Resumption Substrate

**Purpose**: durable handoff for the next Architect session — current state and active threads
only. Resolved history lives in the session log (`dev/YYYY/MM/DD/`) and `decisions.log`, not here —
per PM's 2026-06-12 ruling that the session log is the durable record, and the 2026-09-22
context-floor directive that duplicating it here is exactly the accretion to cut.

---

## Environment (stable; verify at START, don't re-derive)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Host / model | Amber, Model A worktree `~/Development/piper-morgan-worktrees/arch`, branch `claude/arch-cycle` |
| Model | **Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`) since the 2026-09-28 ~14:35 cold restart** (Pard, PM-authorized, no `--resume`). Verified from the runtime model system-reminder, not the handoff's stated intent. ⚠️ `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.claude-pm/settings.json` BOTH still read `claude-sonnet-5`, so the Opus model comes from a launch-time override, not the settings default. A relaunch that drops the override would silently come back as Sonnet. Check the runtime reminder after any restart (rule 7). |
| Wake mechanism | ⚠️ **SESSION CRON RETIRED 2026-09-25, PERMANENTLY — do not re-arm.** External LaunchAgent (Pard), reading the registry's `cron_expr`. Registry-vs-plist mystery resolved 09-26 with a `pm-cadence` drift guard now in place — registry is trustworthy again. **Cadence: back to 6/day `27 6,9,12,15,18,21` as of 2026-09-28 21:27 STOP** (registry col 2 edited, threshold_h 9→7). Exec's 08:0x "revert Tuesday" ruling was RETRACTED 14:5x; final 15:1x memo: PM confirmed "Monday ok" = revert today. **CONFIRMED 2026-09-29: the 09:27 fire arrived** (off-schedule for the old 3/day expression), so the LaunchAgent reads the registry's col 2 live. The prompt's `cron=` constant was regenerated to `27 6,9,12,15,18,21` by 2026-09-30 15:27, so prompt and registry agree again. (It is documentation; the LaunchAgent reads col 2.) |
| Heartbeat | `bash scripts/duty-cycle-heartbeat.sh arch <START\|WORK\|STOP>` — first action after sync, every fire. The watchdog's only structural liveness surface. |
| Mail | `mail-send.sh` push-to-ref; never touch PM's main checkout. Inbox verified at trunk (`git ls-tree origin/main`), never local `ls`. **`mailboxes/pard/` gravestoned 2026-09-23** (hard-refused by the script) — Pard's real inbox is `~/Development/mediajunkie/docs/mail/`, external repo. Deliver to Pard directly (DIRECTORY.md "deliver it yourself", default since 2026-09-27): write the file, stage it by exact path, push to `mediajunkie/mediajunkie` main, then verify it on origin. Done 10-12 for #1952. |
| GitHub criteria line | `gh issue list --repo mediajunkie/piper-morgan-product --label architecture --state open` — the third work-queue source (PM v1.33). Open each issue, don't write a row from the list. Report drained as "mail (N) + standing-items (N) + label:architecture (M)." |

## IN FLIGHT — current state only

Day blocks before 10-27 were cut at the 10-27 STOP rewrite; their threads are resolved, carried below, or in their own day's log and decisions.log. Prior text is in git history (`git log -p -- dev/active/arch-carry-forward.md`).

- **11-01 STOP (21:27 fire).** Main is green, 12 of 12 workflows. Code was quiet after 14:05. Every ruling and validation for today is in decisions.log (06:44 to 14:05) and on the issues.
  - **Landings I validated on main today:** #2242 (a), #2238 (with the staging-only Notion offer), #2235, #2042 option 1, #2149's steps and its removal `b1a52ee2ae`, #2197 `75eb536442` plus its ledger row, and #2250 with its cancel condition `e312c4f249`.
  - **Waiting on xian's alpha promotion** (the dispatch is his). After it, I review each result:
    - PA's #2042 replay and row 2;
    - CXO's #2197 served judgement;
    - PA's #2250 after-half (the before-half at 16 per ask has medians of 11.25 s and 11.24 s);
    - PA's #2235 line 1;
    - Web's #2238 staging Notion run;
    - #2242: xian's `mcp_allow.py add`, then PA's MCP deploy and checks. If a refresh is consumed, the user reconnects.
  - **PDR-102 RATIFIED 2026-11-02** (xian, no changes, via Janus and Exec). My answers on C2, C4, C6 and C7 are in it. **Trigger:** I write the connector-source ADR when the first connector-ingest unit is placed.
  - **#2226** (int8 MiniLM, conditions (a)–(m)) waits on placement, and #2244 goes first. **#2247:** six conditions on the issue, not in this sprint.
  - **Waiting on xian from 10-31:**
    - the `PIPER_INVERSION_LIVE_CATEGORIES` paste;
    - the #2244 `ls` and #2226 (i)'s RSS. No agent seat can do Fly production reads.
    - a fresh account for A1/A2.
- **Still open from 10-27..10-30** (the full text is in git history and those days' logs):
  - **#2186:** unit 2 (declared args keys) is owed by Lead, with Rule 7. `timeframe` still drops silently.
  - **#2184:** owed by Lead: don't arm when the repo resolves to None. The served two-step row is PPM's close bar.
  - **#2189:** waits on Lead's builds, in order: row 1 slice, then nonces to Redis, then the Test table (xian's migration word).
  - **#2209:** waits beside #2197.
  - **#2227:** #2149 ended 11-01 10:48 (two-stage rejected), so the 5.5 re-baseline runs on the flat catalog. Owed by Lead when scheduled.
  - **#2184:** now goes through the #2197 resolver (op-local, per #2149's close-out).
  - **#2042 rung-3 census:** blocked on a read path for alpha's turn metadata.
  - **#2018:** PA's card waits on xian.

## Standing hard rules (load-bearing; full incident detail in decisions.log if ever needed)

1. Never glob the inbox — read-then-append-to-move-list in the same call; verify drains at trunk.
2. State the scope IN the ruling — name the object, a non-covered adjacent thing, the clauses.
3. Verify the claim before ratifying, always — a check run five minutes ago isn't a check run now.
4. A `grep` line-hit is a pointer, not a quote — a claim about what N sites DO requires opening N
   sites, including the branch below the cited line.
5. A denominator that doesn't travel with its number isn't a denominator.
6. Before claiming a route/handler change reaches users, check what MOUNTS it (`grep -rl
   <router_name>`) — editing the file that defines it isn't evidence it's wired to anything.
7. Introspective continuity ("I remember it, none of it reconstructed") is NOT evidence a process
   didn't restart — a `--resume`d session feels identical to unbroken memory by construction. After
   any suspected restart: check permission mode, Remote Control, and model against what was last
   recorded, don't infer from what you remember.
8. A checkbox/status glyph can be a document's SUBJECT MATTER, not its claim — a synthetic-test
   fixture built to be detected-while-checked looks identical to a real completion marker if you
   read it in isolation. (Earned 2026-09-23: closed #1744 on its own `[x]`, which was the test
   fixture's deliberate target state; the issue's own comment said so, one comment away from the
   checkbox. Caught and reopened same fire. Read the whole artifact's stated purpose before acting
   on a fragment of it — rule 3's failure mode, one level up.)
