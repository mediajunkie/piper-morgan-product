# PPM Carry-Forward

**Role**: Principal Product Manager (PPM)

**★ THIRD-QUEUE-SOURCE CRITERIA LINE (adopted 2026-09-22, per v1.33's ruling; `--limit` bug fixed
2026-09-23 13:22)** — run at every START/WATCH, not just when remembered:
```bash
gh issue list --repo mediajunkie/piper-morgan-product --milestone MVP --state open --limit 500 --json number --jq '.[].number' | sort -n | uniq > /tmp/list1.txt
grep -oE '#[0-9]{4}' dev/active/mvp-epic-order-2026-09-09.md | tr -d '#' | sort -n | uniq > /tmp/list2.txt
comm -23 /tmp/list1.txt /tmp/list2.txt   # every MVP-open issue NOT mentioned in the epic-order file
```
⚠️ **`--limit 500` is REQUIRED, not optional — its absence was a live bug from adoption until
2026-09-23 13:22.** `gh issue list` silently defaults to `--limit 30` with no warning. The original
form of this line (no `--limit` flag) had been reporting a stable "denominator 30, 0 gap" since
2026-09-22 — which was true of the *first 30* MVP-open issues and silently blind to the other
~27-29 that exist. Caught 2026-09-23 13:22 when a REST-API cross-check (done to work around a
GraphQL throttle) returned 57-59 against the criteria line's own 30 for the same milestone, same
moment. **Low actual blast radius**: the tool had only run twice before the fix (2026-09-22
evening, 2026-09-23 07:22 START), and the 13 gaps it eventually caught (2026-09-23 10:22, via the
REST workaround) were mostly issues filed well before the tool existed — the bug delayed
*discovery*, it didn't cause new gaps to form. Re-verified clean post-fix: 0 gap, denominator 57.
**Must be `#[0-9]{4}` (4-digit only), not a bare `#[0-9]+`** — the looser regex matches informal
non-issue references already in the file's own prose (*"cousin #3," "Lead's #4"*) and produced 30
false positives against 11 real ones when first tried. Any non-empty output = a real MVP item with
no epic home; read each issue's title/body before placing, don't guess from the number alone. State
the denominator when reporting (the `wc -l` of list1.txt) per the third-queue-source discipline.

**Last rewritten**: 2026-10-01 22:2x PT (STOP, day-close). Cron rotated (`b45e03fb` → `7ccd8695`,
same expression, standard rotation).

**Watching**: `#1606` (real, open, MVP issue) is ruled but blocked on a 4b design extension
(Arch ruled, Lead building in a fresh session — named trigger, not a deferral). Check for closure
next fire or later and strike it in the epic file then.

**Day's substantive work**: heaviest Phase-3 corpus-deposit day this week — 5 joint PPM/CXO
rulings across GITHUB/TEMPORAL/STATUS. Own process note worth carrying forward: got
STATUS_PATTERNS family B wrong (ruled `attention_query`), conceded to CXO's sharper ownership-vs-
urgency distinction (`floor`) — a destination being real and useful isn't the same as it answering
the specific question asked. First time this seat's own ruling needed that correction rather than
catching it elsewhere. Board hygiene caught 8 new issues across the day (5 MVP, 3 `Ongoing`), all
milestoned/board-placed same-fire; both instruments clean, denominator settled at 29.

**No externally-blocked items.** No other open threads.
