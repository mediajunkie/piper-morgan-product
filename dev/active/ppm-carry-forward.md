# PPM Carry-Forward

**Role**: Principal Product Manager (PPM)

**★ THIRD-QUEUE-SOURCE CRITERIA LINE (adopted 2026-09-22, per v1.33's ruling; `--limit` bug fixed
2026-09-23 13:22)** — run at every START/WATCH, not just when remembered:
```bash
gh issue list --repo mediajunkie/piper-morgan-product --milestone MVP --state open --limit 500 --json number --jq '.[].number' | sort -n | uniq > /tmp/list1.txt
grep -oE '#[0-9]{4}' dev/active/mvp-epic-order-2026-09-09.md | tr -d '#' | sort -n | uniq > /tmp/list2.txt
comm -23 /tmp/list1.txt /tmp/list2.txt   # every MVP-open issue NOT mentioned in the epic-order file
```
⚠️ **`--limit 500` is REQUIRED, not optional — its absence was a live bug from adoption until
2026-09-23 13:22.** `gh issue list` silently defaults to `--limit 30` with no warning. The original
form of this line (no `--limit` flag) had been reporting a stable "denominator 30, 0 gap" since
2026-09-22 — which was true of the *first 30* MVP-open issues and silently blind to the other
~27-29 that exist. Caught 2026-09-23 13:22 when a REST-API cross-check (done to work around a
GraphQL throttle) returned 57-59 against the criteria line's own 30 for the same milestone, same
moment. **Low actual blast radius**: the tool had only run twice before the fix (2026-09-22
evening, 2026-09-23 07:22 START), and the 13 gaps it eventually caught (2026-09-23 10:22, via the
REST workaround) were mostly issues filed well before the tool existed — the bug delayed
*discovery*, it didn't cause new gaps to form. Re-verified clean post-fix: 0 gap, denominator 57.
**Must be `#[0-9]{4}` (4-digit only), not a bare `#[0-9]+`** — the looser regex matches informal
non-issue references already in the file's own prose (*"cousin #3," "Lead's #4"*) and produced 30
false positives against 11 real ones when first tried. Any non-empty output = a real MVP item with
no epic home; read each issue's title/body before placing, don't guess from the number alone. State
the denominator when reporting (the `wc -l` of list1.txt) per the third-queue-source discipline.

**Last rewritten**: 2026-09-23 13:22 PT (WORK). Lead ruled `#1595` gets its own top-level "epic 0"
slot (the interpretation spine, default sink for other epics' routing findings) — placed with
Lead's own build-status line, replacing the morning's flag-note. Found + fixed a real bug in the
criteria line itself: `gh issue list` defaults `--limit 30` with no warning, so it had been
silently checking only the first 30 of ~57-59 MVP-open issues since adoption — `--limit 500` now
required, documented inline above. Board hygiene: 5 of this morning's 6 board-adds reported
`NOT ON THE BOARD` again by `sprint-truth.py`; re-added + re-set Status, but a direct per-issue
GraphQL check shows all 5 genuinely on the board — working theory is `gh project item-list` read
lag, not a real second removal, unresolved. 2 unmilestoned issues found via direct query (the
count-only field sprint-truth.py doesn't itemize): `#1863` (this seat's own previously-watched lens
Rule-0 item, now filed) and `#1861` (Lead's dev-instrument repair) — both milestoned/placed. Full
detail in today's session log, 13:22 WORK entry. Nothing PM-gated carried forward; the board-lag
question is worth a fresh check next fire, not urgent.
