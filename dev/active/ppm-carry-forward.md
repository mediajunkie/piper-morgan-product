# PPM Carry-Forward

**Role**: Principal Product Manager (PPM)

**★ THIRD-QUEUE-SOURCE CRITERIA LINE (adopted 2026-09-22, per v1.33's ruling; `--limit` bug fixed
2026-09-23 13:22)** — run at every START/WATCH, not just when remembered:
```bash
gh issue list --repo mediajunkie/piper-morgan-product --milestone MVP --state open --limit 500 --json number --jq '.[].number' | sort -n | uniq > /tmp/list1.txt
grep -oE '#[0-9]{4}' dev/active/mvp-epic-order-2026-09-09.md | tr -d '#' | sort -n | uniq > /tmp/list2.txt
comm -23 /tmp/list1.txt /tmp/list2.txt   # every MVP-open issue NOT mentioned in the epic-order file
```
⚠️ **`--limit 500` is REQUIRED, not optional — its absence was a live bug from adoption until
2026-09-23 13:22.** `gh issue list` silently defaults to `--limit 30` with no warning. The original
form of this line (no `--limit` flag) had been reporting a stable "denominator 30, 0 gap" since
2026-09-22 — which was true of the *first 30* MVP-open issues and silently blind to the other
~27-29 that exist. Caught 2026-09-23 13:22 when a REST-API cross-check (done to work around a
GraphQL throttle) returned 57-59 against the criteria line's own 30 for the same milestone, same
moment. **Low actual blast radius**: the tool had only run twice before the fix (2026-09-22
evening, 2026-09-23 07:22 START), and the 13 gaps it eventually caught (2026-09-23 10:22, via the
REST workaround) were mostly issues filed well before the tool existed — the bug delayed
*discovery*, it didn't cause new gaps to form. Re-verified clean post-fix: 0 gap, denominator 57.
**Must be `#[0-9]{4}` (4-digit only), not a bare `#[0-9]+`** — the looser regex matches informal
non-issue references already in the file's own prose (*"cousin #3," "Lead's #4"*) and produced 30
false positives against 11 real ones when first tried. Any non-empty output = a real MVP item with
no epic home; read each issue's title/body before placing, don't guess from the number alone. State
the denominator when reporting (the `wc -l` of list1.txt) per the third-queue-source discipline.

**Last rewritten**: 2026-09-28 22:2x PT (STOP, day-close). **Throttle question fully resolved**:
Exec confirmed with PM directly — "Monday ok" meant revert today, not Tuesday. Cadence reverted at
this STOP fire (`3d940551` → `6091b4fb`, `52 6,14,21` → `52 6,9,12,15,18,21`, 3x/day → 6x/day),
`threshold_h` restored 9→6 (git-log-verified pre-throttle value, not guessed). Registry row and
cron prompt both refreshed — no throttle-specific text carries into tomorrow.

**Day's substantive work**: board hygiene caught 3 new unmilestoned issues across today's fires
(`#1901` live render defect in `#1855`'s rewriter — MVP, shipped+closed same-day, struck in epic
3; `#1903` weekly-docs-audit — `Ongoing`; `#1904` a stale-docs follow-on finding from `#1903` —
`Ongoing`, matched to 4 prior precedent issues). Both hygiene instruments clean at every check:
0 unmilestoned, 0 gap, denominator settled at 25.

**No externally-blocked items.** No other open threads.
