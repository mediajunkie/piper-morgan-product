# PPM Carry-Forward

**Role**: Principal Product Manager (PPM)

**★ THIRD-QUEUE-SOURCE CRITERIA LINE (adopted 2026-09-22, per v1.33's ruling; `--limit` bug fixed
2026-09-23 13:22)** — run at every START/WATCH, not just when remembered:
```bash
gh issue list --repo mediajunkie/piper-morgan-product --milestone MVP --state open --limit 500 --json number --jq '.[].number' | sort -n | uniq > /tmp/list1.txt
grep -oE '#[0-9]{4}' dev/active/mvp-epic-order-2026-09-09.md | tr -d '#' | sort -n | uniq > /tmp/list2.txt
comm -23 /tmp/list1.txt /tmp/list2.txt   # every MVP-open issue NOT mentioned in the epic-order file
```
⚠️ **`--limit 500` is REQUIRED, not optional — its absence was a live bug from adoption until
2026-09-23 13:22.** `gh issue list` silently defaults to `--limit 30` with no warning. The original
form of this line (no `--limit` flag) had been reporting a stable "denominator 30, 0 gap" since
2026-09-22 — which was true of the *first 30* MVP-open issues and silently blind to the other
~27-29 that exist. Caught 2026-09-23 13:22 when a REST-API cross-check (done to work around a
GraphQL throttle) returned 57-59 against the criteria line's own 30 for the same milestone, same
moment. **Low actual blast radius**: the tool had only run twice before the fix (2026-09-22
evening, 2026-09-23 07:22 START), and the 13 gaps it eventually caught (2026-09-23 10:22, via the
REST workaround) were mostly issues filed well before the tool existed — the bug delayed
*discovery*, it didn't cause new gaps to form. Re-verified clean post-fix: 0 gap, denominator 57.
**Must be `#[0-9]{4}` (4-digit only), not a bare `#[0-9]+`** — the looser regex matches informal
non-issue references already in the file's own prose (*"cousin #3," "Lead's #4"*) and produced 30
false positives against 11 real ones when first tried. Any non-empty output = a real MVP item with
no epic home; read each issue's title/body before placing, don't guess from the number alone. State
the denominator when reporting (the `wc -l` of list1.txt) per the third-queue-source discipline.

**Last rewritten**: 2026-10-02 07:3x PT (START). Cron unchanged (`7ccd8695`), no re-arm needed.

**`#1606` closed** (Lead shipped the 4b floor-element extension live on v163) — struck in the epic
file, no longer watched.

**Filed the Ship #063 workstream review** (window Fri 09-25 → Thu 10-01) to Exec, cc PM — ahead of
the Saturday-midday nudge point, per Exec's own "write it now" framing. Named two self-corrections
plainly: the `#1890` wire-vs-dispose miss (09-27) and the STATUS_PATTERNS family-B correction
(10-01, conceded to CXO's ownership-vs-urgency distinction).

**Known-good board state as of 07:24 PDT this morning** (pre-review-writing): 28 not done, 1223
done, 0 unmilestoned, 0 gap, denominator 28. **A later re-check this same fire failed on a
genuine external GitHub API issue** (`gh project` commands returning "unknown owner type," a
`gh repo view` call hitting the shared fleet-wide rate limit even with healthy quota moments
before) — not re-confirmed since; re-check at the next fire rather than treat the failure as a
clear or keep retrying against a shared resource.

**No externally-blocked items.** No other open threads.
